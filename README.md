# ParallelSearch
Parallel search of a building to find a hidden person.

This program starts from the command line. Enter the number of floors to create a building and the program randomly hides a person in a room. The program then creates
a worker for each floor of the building and they begin to search each room for the hidden person in parallel. Once the hidden person is found the worker returns the
floor and room number.
